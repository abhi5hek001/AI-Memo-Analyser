## 1. Executive Summary
SkyCrate is a hyperlocal logistics startup building a network of autonomous delivery drones that can transport small packages across cities in under 10 minutes. With rising demand for instant deliveries and increasing urban congestion, SkyCrate offers a fast, sustainable, and low-cost alternative. The company is seeking a $1.2M seed round to scale its pilot fleet, expand operations, and secure regulatory clearances.

---

## 2. Problem
Urban delivery systems are congested, slow, and costly.

- Traditional bike-based deliveries often take 20–40 minutes for a 2–3 km trip.  
- Congestion and traffic unpredictability drive up costs for logistics operators.  
- Customers expect **instant** deliveries, especially for medicine, food, and essential items.  
- Small businesses struggle to meet rapid-delivery expectations without hurting margins.

There is no scalable, sustainable, ultra-fast logistics layer for cities.

---

## 3. Solution
SkyCrate builds a fleet of autonomous, lightweight drones designed for short-range, high-frequency urban deliveries.

**Key features:**
- Autonomous route planning using onboard vision + LIDAR  
- 2 kg payload limit  
- 10–12 minute delivery time within 5 km radius  
- Smart docking stations placed at partner stores  
- Real-time API for small businesses to automate dispatch  

SkyCrate replaces traffic with skyways — creating an aerial logistics layer that is faster, greener, and cheaper.

## 4. Market Opportunity
**TAM:** $45B (Global last-mile delivery market for small parcels)  
**SAM:** $6B (Urban short-range deliveries in India + Southeast Asia)  
**SOM:** $150M (Pilot cities + high-density neighborhoods targetable within 5 years)

**Trends supporting the opportunity:**
- Surge of 15–25 minute delivery expectations  
- Regulatory bodies opening controlled drone corridors  
- Advancements in low-cost micro-aviation hardware  

Urban logistics is ripe for disruption.

## 5. Business Model
SkyCrate operates on a B2B SaaS + per-delivery fee structure:

- ₹8–₹20 per delivery (depending on distance and weight)  
- Subscription for drone-dock access for partner stores  
- Enterprise API priced at ₹6,000/month  

Projected margins exceed 40% once hardware costs stabilize.
